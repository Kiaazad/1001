- Jafar: "Three wishes?"
Why is it a question?  It should be a statement, "Three wishes."
- Jafar: "I was about to say: How easy is it to let people die on their own?"
Should it be a statement instead of a question?  "How easy it is to let people die on their own."

Wishes:
I wish to be a God: 
- Jafar: "so you want to be something that doesn't exist?"
"So", should be capitalized, "So you want to be something that doesn't exist?"
- Jafar: "Too late for buts Abdul.  You are done for now, this was your last mistake!"
Abdul's name appears, "Too late for buts.  You are done for now, this was your last mistake!"
I wish to be indestructible:
- Jafar: "As a rock?"
"Like", might be a better word choice and maybe even the word "a" can be omitted.  "Like rock?"
- Jafar: "if that's your wish, you'll be like a rock. hard, heavy and lifeless!"
The first word in the sentences need to be capitalized, "If that's your wish, you'll be like a rock.  Hard, heavy and lifeless!"
- Jafar: "As an iron?"
Odd word choice, "Like iron?"
- The [no] option is lowercase and should be capitalized, [No]
- Jafar: "if that's your wish, you'll be like an iron. hard, heavy and lifeless!"
The first letter of the sentences should be capitalized and the word "an" should be omitted, "If that's your wish, you'll be like iron.  Hard, heavy and lifeless!"

I wish to be rich:
- Me: "These coins have your faces on it.  Even the bills have your faces too.  That's not right."
"Faces" shouldn't have an "s" and the word "too" can be omitted.  "These coins have your face on it.  Even the bills have your face.  That's not right."
I wish to be clever:
- Jafar: "Okay, you are smart and all but it's not a guarantee that you'll become a successful business owner again."
How does he know we owned a business?  Word choice left over from when the player was Abdul?
"Okay, you are smart and all, but there's no guarantee that you'll be a successful business owner."
I wish to have a well that never runs dry:
- Me: "Wait!  Moist?  but I want water."
"But" should be capitalized.  "Wait!  Moist?  But I want water."
I wish my mother was alive:
- Jafar: "She's alive alright, though she can't do much more than suffering with her flesh rotting away."
"Suffering" should be "suffer",  "She's alive alright, though she can't do much more than suffer with her flesh rotting away."
I wish I can breath underwater:
- "Can" is incorrect.  It should be "could".  "Breath" should be "breathe".   [I wish I could breathe underwater.]
- Jafar: "abaladu'vali'na"
Should it be capitalized?  "Abaladu'vali'na."
- Jafar: "The reason people drown is the lack of breathable air under water, it's not their inability to breath there."
"Underwater" is one word, and it should be "breathe".  "The reason people drown is the lack of breathable air underwater, it's not their inability to breathe there."
- Jafar: "You wished for something you already have. and I granted it.  Your mistake, not my problem."
Comma instead of a period?  "You wished for something you already have, and I granted it.  Your mistake, not my problem." 
I wish for a flying carpet:
- Jafar: "."
Is he meant to say something here?  Maybe just "…" if not.
I wish for a stallion:
- Jafar: "ajji,maji,ahhhh…"
Should it be capitalized?  "Ajji, maji, ahhhh..."
- Me: "You even put the equipments on too!"
"Equipments" should be without the "s", but maybe another word should be used.  Riding gear?  Tack is the proper term, but I don't think its common knowledge.  "You even put the riding gear on too!"
- Me: "Ah!  It should the same as riding a camel, so it should be easy!"
Missing the word "be".  "Ah!  It should be the same as riding a camel, so it should be easy!"
- Me: "Hmm...But I never ride a camel before, but I'm sure I'll be fine."
"Ridden" should be used instead of "ride".  "But" should be lowercase.  "Hmm...but I've never ridden a camel before, but I'm sure I'll be fine." 
I wish for everlasting dinar:
- The option is misspelled.  Dinar is a currency, dinner is a meal.  Maybe the word "an" should be added.  [I wish for an everlasting dinner.]

 I wish for a jar of vine that never gets empty:
- The option is misspelled and should be "wine".   [I wish for a jar of wine that never gets empty.]
I wish for a jewelry store:
- Me: "Whoa!  Look at all the jewelries I can sell for profit!"
"Jewelry" should be used instead of "jewelries".  "Whoa!  Look at all the jewelry I can sell for profit!"
I wish for a cup of water:
- Me: "Did something splashed at my face?"
"Splash" instead of "splashed" and "on" instead of "at".  "Did something splash on my face?"
I wish to move to the oasis:
- Me: "It's just a background art?"
"A" is not needed.  "It's just background art?"
- Jafar: "Looks lovely, isn't it?"
"Doesn't" instead of "isn't".  "Looks lovely, doesn't it?"
# Remaining

- Jafar: Then what? 
All the choices need capitalization.  [A statue!]  [A tree!]  [Like Hercules!] [Like a god!]
- Jafar: "I'll let you give me your first wish...and second wish…"
Wording is a bit awkward.  Simplify it?  "Give me your first wish...and second wish..."



# Done
Locations:
- Heaven Oasis, and now the Farms, have the incorrect label of, "Main street". 
Characters:
- Soodeh has no character art when you go back to speak to her on your own. 
- Before discovering Vantage Point, when you go up the mountain, it is labeled "Agrabah".
- Question, "Orchids" did you mean it to be flowers or did you want a tree grove, orchards? 
- Orge Monster, in The Watch Tower, doesn't attack.  Instead, a message appears saying, "The fight system is being reworked to fit the first person view." 
- When you decide to not rub the lamp, Jasmine doesn't appear, and you can't leave Snake's Pass.  The snake located there does attack, which might prevent the Jasmine event from triggering. 

# Remaining

- The Palace, doesn't have a location name, label, when inside.
- Your home base has the basic label of "Agrabah".
Notes:
Exploring is challenging due to enemy attacks and escaping becoming harder.  An item, to avoid combat,  might be a valuable item some shady merchant can sell for a high price.

# Done
- Little Thief stays dead and doesn't respawn.  She keeps attacking even while dead.
- It's hard to escape from a dead enemy.
- It's hard to escape from the training dummy.  It does feel like something Jafar would do to make your character have to fight/level up.
- If you type in your name, closing the game and reloading a save reverts your name back to "Me" when speaking with others.
- Should sleeping restore all/more health?  If your health gets too low, you have to sleep a few times to restore it all.
Text Errors:
- Teacher: "The guards have confiscated all the books that Jafar have donated in the years he have been the royal Vizier."
Text is awkward and has unnecessary words.  "The guards confiscated all the books Jafar donated as the royal Vizier."
Your character while speaking to Jafar about Ahmad.
- Me: "But he still have both hands!"
"Has" instead of "have".  "But he still has both hands!"
- Jafar: "I've let him keep them in exchange for him acquiring some items for me."
"I let him keep them, and in exchange he acquired some items for me."
